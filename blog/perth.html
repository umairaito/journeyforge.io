        <p>Perth is one of the most isolated yet captivating cities in the world. Sitting on the Swan River in Western Australia, this sun-soaked capital offers pristine beaches, world-class wineries, and unique wildlife you won't find anywhere else. Here's our guide to the 10 best things to do in Perth.</p>

        <h2>1. Chill at Cottesloe Beach</h2>
        <p>Perth's most iconic beach is a must-visit. With its crystal-clear waters, golden sands, and iconic Norfolk pines, Cottesloe is perfect for swimming, surfing, or just relaxing with fish and chips by the sea. The annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition transforms the beach into an outdoor gallery each March.</p>

        <h2>2. Explore Kings Park and Botanic Garden</h2>
        <p>One of the world's largest inner-city parks, Kings Park offers stunning views of the Perth skyline and Swan River. Walk through the treetop walk, explore the native Australian gardens, or pack a picnic and enjoy the sunshine. It's free and open every day.</p>

        <h2>3. Take a Swan River Cruise</h2>
        <p>Hop on a ferry from Elizabeth Quay and cruise down the Swan River to Fremantle. You'll pass by million-dollar mansions, wildlife spotting opportunities, and enjoy commentary about Perth's history. It's both relaxing and scenic.</p>

        <h2>4. Visit Fremantle (Freo)</h2>
        <p>This historic port town is充满 character. Explore the Fremantle Markets (open Friday-Sunday), grab a coffee at the famous "The Little Creatures" brewery, and wander through the colonial architecture. Don't miss the Fremantle Prison for a hauntingly good guided tour.</p>

        <h2>5. Swim with Wild Sea Lions at Rockingham</h2>
        <p>Just 45 minutes from Perth, Rockingham offers the incredible opportunity to swim with wild sea lions in their natural habitat. These playful creatures are curious and friendly, making this an unforgettable experience. Book through licensed tour operators for the best encounter.</p>

        <h2>6. Day Trip to Rottnest Island</h2>
        <p>Take a ferry from Fremantle or Perth to Rottnest Island (about 90 minutes). This car-free island is home to the adorable quokka — Australia's happiest animal! Rent a bike, explore the beaches, and snap a selfie with a quokka. It's the perfect day trip.</p>

        <h2>7. Wine Tasting in Swan Valley</h2>
        <p>Just 25 minutes from Perth, Swan Valley is one of Australia's oldest wine regions. Visit cellar doors at Houghtons, Mandoon Estate, and Sittella for wine tastings. Pair with local cheese, chocolate, and produce. It's wine country at its finest, right on Perth's doorstep.</p>

        <h2>8. Watch the Sunset at Scarborough Beach</h2>
        <p>Perth has incredible sunsets, and Scarborough Beach is the best place to watch them. Grab fish and chips, find a spot on the sand, and enjoy the show. The area has great restaurants and bars for after-dark entertainment too.</p>

        <h2>9. Discover Aboriginal Culture at WA Museum Boola Bardip</h2>
        <p>Perth's flagship museum offers fascinating insights into Western Australia's Aboriginal heritage and natural history. The building itself is architectural masterpiece. Allow at least 2-3 hours to explore all the galleries. Entry is free!</p>

        <h2>10. Hit the Bars in Northbridge</h2>
        <p>Perth's nightlife hub, Northbridge, is packed with bars, clubs, and late-night eats. From craft beer at The Old Bar to cocktails at Helvetica, there's something for everyone. It's walkable and friendly, perfect for a night out.</p>

        <h2>Best Time to Visit Perth</h2>
        <p><strong>Summer (December-February)</strong> is peak tourist season with hot days (30-40°C). <strong>Autumn (March-May)</strong> offers mild weather and fewer crowds. <strong>Spring (September-November)</strong> brings wildflowers in bloom. Winter is mild but rainy.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around Perth</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transperth:</strong> Clean, reliable public transport with free city CAT buses</li>
            <li><strong>Car rental:</strong> Essential for day trips to Rottnest, Swan Valley, and beyond</li>
