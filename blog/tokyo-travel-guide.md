## Best Time to Visit Tokyo

Tokyo is a year-round destination, but timing matters:

- **March-April:** Cherry blossom season — magical but crowded
- **May-June:** Pleasant weather, fewer crowds
- **July-August:** Summer festivals, but hot and humid
- **September-November:** Fall colors, comfortable temps
- **December-February:** Winter illuminations, fewer tourists

**Pro tip:** Avoid Golden Week (late April-early May) and Obon (mid-August) for fewer crowds.
